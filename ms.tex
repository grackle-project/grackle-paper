% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We present the \texttt{Grackle} chemistry and cooling library for
astrophysical simulations and models.  \texttt{Grackle} provides
a treatment of non-equilibrium primordial chemistry and cooling for H, D, and He
species, including H$_{2}$ formation on dust grains; tabulated
primordial and metal cooling; multiple UV background models; and
support for radiation transfer and arbitrary heat sources.  The
library has an easily implementable interface for simulation codes
written in C, C++, and Fortran as well as a Python interface with
added convenience functions for semi-analytical models.  As an
open-source project, \texttt{Grackle} provides a community resource
for accessing and disseminating astrochemical data and numerical
methods.  We present the full details of the core functionality, the
simulation and Python interfaces, testing infrastructure, performance,
and range of applicability.
