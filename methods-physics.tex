\paragraph{Non-equilibrium}

\paragraph{Tabulated}


\subsubsection{Metal Cooling}
- making the tabulated data

- including in the network

\subsubsection{Chemical Heating and Cooling}


\subsubsection{Dust Heating}



\subsection{Radiation Backgrounds}
- available models

- including in the solver


\subsection{Applicability and Limitations}
- Density ranges, temperature ranges, optically thin condition

- Remind reader that cooling lengths are potentially very short and
having a fancy model is perhaps not very relevant at 1kpc
resolution. Can give some guidance of how to apply this.
