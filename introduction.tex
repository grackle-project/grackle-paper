\subsection{Why is chemistry/radiative cooling necessary in
  simulations?}

Modeling of plasma chemistry and radiative cooling is absolutely
essential in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.  At a
fundamental level, virtually all astrophysical objects begin as a
cloud of diffuse plasma in a gravitational potential that is created
primarily either by the plasma itself (i.e., stars) or by a dark
matter halo (i.e., cosmological structure).  In these situations, in
the absense of any additional physical processes the plasma will
arrange itself so that pressure is in rough equilibrium with gravity,
and no further evolution will occur without some external influence.
Some physical process that allows this plasma to lose energy is
necessary in order to break this stalemate, thus allowing the
formation of stars and galaxies.  The process that typically enables
this energy loss is radiative cooling, often facilitated by a series
of chemical reactions that further enhance the plasma's ability to
lose energy.

Radiative cooling plays a critical role in several important
astrophysical processes.  There is a complex interplay of gas- and
dust-phase chemistry in star formation, which completely dominates the
dynamics of the evolving pre-stellar cloud, and may strongly influence
the resulting stellar initial mass function.
\citep{2002Sci...295...93A,2011ApJ...726...55T,2008AIPC..990...25G} At
a smaller physical scale, radiative cooling can profoundly affect the
structure and behavior of accretion disks around stars and compact
objects.  \citep{1973A&A....24..337S} The shape of the `cooling curve'
of diffuse astrophysical plasmas -- i.e., the cooling rate as a
function of density and temperature -- is responsible for the thermal
instability that generates a multiphase interstellar medium
\citep{1977ApJ...218..148M,1978ppim.book.....S}.  In cosmological
structure formation, gas collapsing into dark matter halos generally
experiences a strong shock at roughly the virial radius, which heats
the gas to roughly the virial temperature.  Optically-thin radiative
cooling of this plasma allows gas to concentrate at the center of dark
matter halos, and ultimately to form molecular clouds and stars.
\citep{1977MNRAS.179..541R,1991ApJ...379...52W}

Chemistry is often an important component of the evolution of
astrophysical plasmas.  The creation of simple molecules via gas- and
dust-phase chemical reactions can greatly enhance the efficacy of
cooling. \citep{1979ApJS...41..555H,2005ApJ...626..627O} The formation
and destruction of simple molecules can be energetically important in
some circumstances, such as Population III star formation.
\citep{1998ApJ...508..141O,2002Sci...295...93A,2008MNRAS.388.1627G,2009Sci...325..601T}
And, from a dynamical perspective, the non-equilibrium evolution of
particular ions can have a strong effect on the ability of gas to cool
\citep{1997NewA....2..181A,1997NewA....2..209A} and on common
observational quantities such as the column density of OVI absorption
line systems in the intergalactic medium that are used to estimate the
metal content of the intergalactic medium and to trace the ``missing
baryons.'' \citep{2006ApJ...650..573C,2011ApJ...731....6S,2013MNRAS.434.1043O,2014ApJ...796...49S}
